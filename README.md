# FEUP-IART
This repository hosts our project for the Artificial Intelligence (IART) course unit of the MIEIC at FEUP.

## Introduction
The aim of this project was the application of neural networks for the prediction of frog species, based on their appeals.

Main difficulties include:
* balancing of the dataset;

## Dataset
Anuran Calls (MFCCs) is a data set which contains acoustic features extracted from syllables of anuran (frogs) calls, including the family, the genus, and the species labels (multilabel) collected by UCI (University of California, Irvine).

Available [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Anuran+Calls+%28MFCCs%29).

## Tools
